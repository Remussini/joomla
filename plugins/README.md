## plg_system_mcm

System plugin to show how to load copies of com_media views and templates instead of their core counterparts for customization without hacking any core Joomla files.

## plg_system_mcm_templates

These protostar com_media template overrides are customized to create a folder such as /images/asset/{assetid} if one does not exist. Then this folder is the open root level folder in the imageslist for browsing and uploading to.
